    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, place the ground beef, breadcrumbs, grated onion,
        beaten egg, finely pressed garlic, salt, ground cumin, red pepper
        flakes, and ground black pepper. Combine all ingredients very well.
        Cover the bowl with stretch film and let the mixture rest and settle in
        the fridge for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have a small bowl of water with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent the
        kofte mix from sticking to your hands while shaping the kofte rolls.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the fan oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
      <li>
        Place baking paper on a large baking pan and set aside. Dip your hand in
        the oily water and take about a small apple size of kofte mixture in
        your palm. Log roll it for about 12 cm in length and gently pat to
        flatten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat this until all kofte mixture is used up. Place the kofte rolls
        side by side on the baking tray with about 3-4 cm space between them.
        You will have a total of 10 Beyti kofte rolls.
      </li>
      <li>Bake the kofte rolls in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Once the Beyti kofte rolls are baked, take the baking tray out of the
        oven and reduce the oven temperature to 160°C fan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the Beyti kofte rolls one by one on a large plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place and pat the thin flour tortillas over the Beyti kofte tray to soak
        up the kofte juice, then transfer them to a dry and clean surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 2 (two) Beyti kofte rolls end to end on each thin dough tortilla
        to make one long roll. Roll them tightly into a log shape. Cut the log
        rolls into 4 or 5 equal pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a clean baking paper on the baking tray and arrange the Beyti
        rolls seam-side down on the tray. Repeat until all remaining kofte rolls
        are finished.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the top of the tortilla rolls with a little olive oil and bake
        them for about 5 minutes to make the tortilla rolls crispy.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the Beyti kofte rolls are baking, prepare the tomato sauce. Pour
        olive oil into a frying pan and add chopped garlic. Sauté for about one
        minute on medium heat. Add the grated tomatoes, tomato paste, and ground
        red pepper, then combine well. Simmer on medium to low heat for about 3
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After preparing the tomato sauce, make the garlic yogurt mix. Combine
        the chopped garlic with the yogurt and set aside at room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the Beyti kebab plate. Remove the baked rolls from the oven and
        place them in a circle shape on a serving plate. Place the garlic yogurt
        mix in the middle of the plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle tomato sauce over the Beyti rolls and the garlic yogurt. Garnish
        with chopped parsley.
      </li>
      <li>Serve.</li>
